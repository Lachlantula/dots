# dots
## by lachlantula (Lachlan Shoesmith).

This repository contains a collection of dotfiles that I use across both macOS and Arch Linux. ⚙️

## What's up with the ##Darwin and ##Linux after the file extension?

For dotfile management I use [YADM](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm), which automates 'alternative files'. By putting that after the file name YADM can tell which file to use, respective of the operating system.
